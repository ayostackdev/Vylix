"""Solved Question Bank services.

Two-stage pipeline that turns past-question papers into a cached library of
solved questions (the high-margin paid product):

1. ``extract_questions`` pulls individual questions out of an exam paper.
2. ``solve_question`` produces a structured answer (answer/explanation/mistake).

Both run on Gemini 2.0 Flash via ``app.services.gemini.call``. Because the
output is stored in the DB and served as content, the marginal cost of serving
an answer to an unlimited number of students is ~₦0.
