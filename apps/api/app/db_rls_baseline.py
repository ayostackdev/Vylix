"""RLS baseline: single source of truth for row-level security state.

Shared by ``alembic`` migration 030 and the RLS audit test-suite so the
migration, CI, and local verification can never drift apart.

Design contract (matches ``app.db_rls.apply_rls_context``):

* Every request that should see *user-scoped* rows sets
  ``app.current_user_id`` (transaction-local) before querying.
* Policies therefore read ``current_setting('app.current_user_id', true)``:
  - when SET     -> only rows owned by (or shared with) that user pass;
  - when ABSENT  -> everything passes, because Celery workers, migrations
    and other service paths run without a user context.

Migration 004 defined a ``_NO_CTX`` escape hatch but never used it in any
policy, and ten later tables were never added at all.  This module encodes
the *intended* end state; ``apply_rls_baseline`` is idempotent and safe to
re-run against any environment.
